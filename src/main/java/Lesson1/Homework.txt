HOMEWORK #1
Solve all problems that are given below using Java. Choose how to separate tasks in code. Please, try to solve all tasks by yourself.


1.	Write a Java program to print the sum of two numbers.
Test Data:
74 + 36
Expected Output :
110


2.	Write a Java program to print the result of the following operations.
Test Data:
a. -5 + 8 * 6
b. (55+9) % 9
c. 20 + -3*5 / 8
d. 5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3
Expected Output :
43
1
19
13


3.	Write a Java program to print the sum (addition), multiply, subtract, divide and remainder of two numbers. (Create a separate method for each operation)
Test Data:
Input first number: 125
Input second number: 24
Expected Output :
125 + 24 = 149
125 - 24 = 101
125 x 24 = 3000
125 / 24 = 5
125 mod 24 = 5


4.	Write a Java program to sum values of an array.
Test Data:
[5,6,7,12,-5,32,43]
Expected Output : 100


5.	Write a Java program to find the duplicate values of an array of integer values.
Test Data:
[5,6,7,12,-5,32,43,6,12]
Expected Output : 6,12


6.	Write a Java program to concatenate a given string to the end of another string. And remove all `P` or `p` characters.
Test Data:
String 1: PHP Exercises and
String 2: Python Exercises
Expected output:
The concatenated string with replacements: H Exercises and ython Exercises
